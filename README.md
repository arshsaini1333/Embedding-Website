# 🖼 Auto Scrolling Long Image Card

A simple HTML/CSS component that continuously scrolls a long image from top to bottom and back, creating a smooth animation loop.
 <!-- You can replace this with an actual gif/screenshot -->

## ✨ Features
- Pure HTML + CSS (no JavaScript required)
- Infinite auto-scroll animation
- Works with any image taller than the container
- Smooth looping animation

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download or copy the `index.html` file.
2. Replace `your-long-image.jpg` with your own tall image.
3. Adjust:
   - `.scroll-card` `width` and `height` for your container size.
   - Animation duration (`12s`) for scroll speed.

## 🛠 Customization
- **Change speed**: Update `animation: scrollImage 12s linear infinite;`
- **Change container size**: Update `.scroll-card` `width` and `height`
- **Change scroll distance**: Update `calc(-100% + 200px)` (replace `200px` with your container height)
